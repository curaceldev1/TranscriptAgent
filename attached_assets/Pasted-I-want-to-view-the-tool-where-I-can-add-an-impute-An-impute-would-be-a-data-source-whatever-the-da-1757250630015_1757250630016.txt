I want to view the tool where I can add an impute. An impute would be a data source, whatever the data source means, but I will be able to put in a data source such as a YouTube link, and it would script the transcript of the YouTube, and then I can add a talk to it, you know, like ChatGPT, and it would, I would say, extract something, tell me this, do this. Basically, where I put an impute with is a link. The link extracts, you know, the product extracts transcript. Let's assume it's YouTube. Maybe I put the link. I select what it is. I can say, okay, this is YouTube. This is Vimeo. This is some audio thing, or this is, you know, I don't know, a meeting, recording, Fireflies, whatever, right? So I can select, I put the URL. Please, I put a URL. I can select what it is, and then the product goes ahead and does the extraction of a transcript. Then I can talk to a transcript. I can say, generate summaries. From this thing, I can say, create this, where I can basically select an AI model. I can use ChatGPT. I can use Cloud. I can use Grok. I can select a model, put in my API key, and then I can go ahead and talk to it. I can say, hey, summarize this message, do this, do that, you know, and obviously, I can select what type of model. If it's OpenAI, I can select use four, use five, use Thinking, use Pro, use Cloud, use Opus, and so on and so forth, right? So a very straightforward use case I see is, I put a YouTube, I'm listening to a podcast. I see a bunch of things they've talked about. I copy the link to the YouTube. I put it in there. Automatically, it extracts the transcript from the YouTube, and I can say, hey, based on what's happening on this YouTube, give me a summary, or, hey, this product, this is about a product podcast. Give me the five attributes of a product manager, or another use case could be I put in a Fireflies link. Again, it extracts a transcript, and then I say to it, hey, based on this meeting notes, you know, create the next steps for me, stuff like that.
